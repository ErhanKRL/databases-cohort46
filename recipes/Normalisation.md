#1NF (First Normal Form):
    All tables in the database comply with this rule. 
    Each cell contains only one value.
    Each column have atomic value, no multiple values
    Unique names for columns.
    No duplicate records (every record has a primary key).

#2NF (Second Normal Form):

    Since all tables adhere to 1NF, all columns of a table are fully dependent on the primary key Therefore, 2NF is satisfied.

3NF (Third Normal Form):

    There are no transitive dependencies in any tables of the database. All columns in any table are directly dependent on the primary key. Thus, 3NF is satisfied.
